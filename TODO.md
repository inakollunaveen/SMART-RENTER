# TODO: Fix CORS and Network Errors

## Steps to Complete:
- [x] Fix trailing space in frontend/src/utils/api.ts API_URL and set to correct backend URL (https://smartrenter1.onrender.com)
- [x] Update backend/server.js CORS origin whitelist to remove duplicate
- [x] Confirm backend routes and frontend API calls use consistent paths (e.g., /api/properties)
- [ ] Test the fixes by running the application and checking for resolved errors
