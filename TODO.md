# TODO: Fix Uploaded Photo Visibility in Search and PropertyDetails

## Tasks
- [x] Modify PropertyDetails.tsx to process photos array after fetching, prepending API_URL to relative paths
- [ ] Test the changes by running the app and verifying photos load in PropertyDetails page
- [ ] If photos still don't load, investigate backend static file serving on deployed server

## Completed
- [x] Analyzed the issue: PropertyDetails.tsx does not process photos like Search.tsx does
- [x] Confirmed backend stores photos as "/uploads/filename.jpg"
- [x] Confirmed API_URL is "https://smartrenter1.onrender.com"
